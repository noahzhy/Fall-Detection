# Realtime Vision-Based Fall Detection with RNN
This repository is based on [chizhanyuefeng/Realtime-Fall-Detection-for-RNN](https://github.com/chizhanyuefeng/Realtime-Fall-Detection-for-RNN)

> Although the approaches based on wearable sensors have provided high detection rates, some of the potential users are reluctant to wear them. The camera in our daily environment forms an optimal context for vision-based systems. Consequently, here we propose a vision-based solution using RNN to decide if a sequence of frames contains a person falling.

## Requirenments
* TensorFlow
* Matplotlib
* OpenCV (include opencv-contrib)
* Numpy
* Python3

## Training & Testing
### Preparing the data
First of all, you need download the fall detection dataset (video only)
